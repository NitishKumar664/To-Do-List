# To-Do-List
This code creates a responsive to-do list web app with features to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks by status (all, pending, completed). It includes a theme switcher, persistent storage with localStorage, and a user-friendly interface. It uses Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and JavaScript classes for functionality and styling.
